# Stocks-affects-of-Covid
The stock market data for 4 big companies, which we expect to have performed well due to lockdown times, and some companies that we expect have suffered from the travel restrictions imposed  worldwide.  We clearly see a sharp drop around March 2020, across all stocks.  The sharp decline in value happened way before the number of cases in the United States started to skyrocket. By the time the pandemic was sweeping across the country in full force, some stocks, like MSFT had already rebounded to levels seen before Covid. By the time the second wave was behind us, Both Msft, Netflix and Even booking were again at the same or higher levels than before Covid. Only American Airlines is still struggling to recover and is at a lower level than it was before.
